# Coworking Agreement

Anaiah - 💕
Kathryn - 🐱


## Accessibility Needs

For things that you’d like me to remember, co-working schedules, and any tasks that will be assigned to me, please give them to me in writing. - 💕

I prefer async communication (e.g. using Slack) over meetings or co-working sessions. - 🐱


## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations

I would prefer to divide the work, do it independently, and come together before the project is due to review our solutions. I also prefer that we give each other status updates (sort of like stand-up updates) on our progress each day before whatever deadline we assign. - 🐱

I’d like to divide work, and then come back to share/explain our solutions to the pieces that we completed. I’m likely going to attempt every wave myself to see my own understanding and would love to compare our solutions and combine them after to create the final working project - 💕


## Learning Style

I am a kinesthetic learner. I learn best through practice and figuring things out. - 💕

I learn best independently instead of group settings. I prefer to review the project, marinate on the concepts and then practice on my own. - 🐱


## Preferred Feedback Style

I prefer clear honest feedback that doesn’t sugarcoat anything. I dont like a-holes LOL, and an added emoji never hurts 😊 ... but i’d rather you be honest and tell me i need to work on a weak point vs not say anything. I also think i receive feedback best when it also includes things i do well. Its easier to remember/relay negative info but i think its important to acknowledge the good as well. - 💕

I'm generally flexible on feedback. I like having explicit instructions and direction but I am also open to changing my solution or path. I'll work on my emoji game. I never use them! - 🐱


## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
True collaboration. I know there are people with different work styles than me and i want to become more flexible and be able to work in their way. - 💕

I want to work on more effective and efficient collaboration. If something is not working, we quickly pivot to the next best option. We divide and conquer to reach our goals more quickly. And ultimately, communicate really well during this and provide frequent status updates. - 🐱


## Optional: Other agreements

My ideal co-working agreement would be: 1) Coming up with a deadline for the project. 2) Dividing the work fairly. 3) Providing daily status updates to each other via Slack so that in the event that one of us is falling behind, the project can be submitted on time. - 🐱
